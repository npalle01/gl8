Solution Architecture – Data Flow
SOR → CR360 → Portal → Audit

1) Sources (SORs)
GL: FYD/IRIS, GLODS, DRM, Axiom, Essbase
CRRT/Reports: CAR GL, Consumer/WMCRD, Commercial, ERA, Y-9C, Y-14A/M/Q, STARE
Legacy: Teradata (as needed)

2) Ingest + Standardize
Landing zone (raw extracts)
DQ checks (completeness, duplicates, sign/currency)
Standardize keys + apply hierarchy mappings
Produce final cleansed attribute data

3) CR360 Enterprise GL Model
Balances at multiple levels (CAASI + hierarchies)
Reconciliation engine (Report vs GL)
Variance store (amount/%, threshold, classification, status)

4) Portal + Workflow + Controls
Dashboard + filters + drill-down
Maker explanation → Checker approval → Certification
Audit log + period lock; evidence pack outputs

5) Downstream Consum



Operating Model (People • Process • Controls)
How it runs monthly/quarterly

Roles
•Viewer: read-only
•Maker: explain variances
•Checker: approve/reject
•Admin: entitlements/config

Cadence & gates
•T-0: Data ingest & DQ gates complete
•T-1: Reconciliation run published
•T-2: Maker explanations + evidence
•T-3: Checker approval + certification
•T-4: Period lock; evidence pack generated

Controls that matter to Audit
•Segregation of duties (maker/checker)
•Immutable audit log (who/what/when + before/after)
•Period lock after finalization; read-only prior months
•SOX/RCSA artifact outputs (variance list + approvals + evidence links)
