POC “swimlane” view (who does what)

DATA PLATFORM (Python)         PORTAL (UI)                 CONTROLS / AUDIT
--------------------           ---------------------       -----------------------
Ingest + cleanse               View dashboard              View audit trail
Map to Enterprise GL model     Drill-down variances        Evidence pack export
Run reconciliation             Maker adds explanation      Period lock enforced
Write variance table           Checker approve/reject      SOX/RCSA outputs

Plan of approach for the prototype (Python-based)

1) What leaders will see (demo storyline)
	1.	Pick a period + report (Monthly / Quarterly)
	2.	System shows Reconciliation Dashboard (status, total variances, above threshold)
	3.	Click into one reconciliation → Report vs GL comparison
	4.	Drill down from high level → CAASI-level detail
	5.	Open a variance → classification + explanation (Maker)
	6.	Submit → Checker approval
	7.	Show audit log + evidence pack output
	8.	Finalize → period locks (no edits)

This mirrors the future-state slides: central model + standardized reconciliation + workflow + audit + downstream reporting.

⸻

POC scope (tight, credible, fast)

Data scope (recommended)
	•	Use 2 GL sources (or 1 GL source + 1 report extract) to start
	•	Use one CRRT/report domain (e.g., CAR Consumer or CAR Commercial)
	•	1–2 legal entities + a subset of accounts (enough to demonstrate drill-down)

Functional scope (must-have in POC)
	•	Ingest → cleanse → map → reconcile
	•	Multi-level reconciliation (at least Entity + Account, ideally include Sub-account/AU)
	•	Variance table with threshold flag
	•	UI screens:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Variance list with filters
	•	Variance detail (explanation + attachments link placeholder)
	•	Maker/Checker approval
	•	Audit log view/export

Nice-to-have (if time)
	•	Anomaly scoring (simple: z-score on historical periods)
	•	Roll-forward comments
	•	Trending chart (variance count/amount over periods)

⸻

Technical approach (Python-first, leader-safe)

Proposed stack (simple + demo-friendly)
	•	Python ETL/Engine: pandas + SQLAlchemy
	•	Database: Postgres (local or container) or SQLite for ultra-light POC
	•	UI: Streamlit (fast) or FastAPI + simple React (more “enterprise”)
	•	Workflow: basic state machine in DB (Maker/Checker statuses)
	•	Audit log: append-only table capturing who/what/when
	•	Exports: generate PDF/CSV evidence packs

Core data tables (POC schema)
	•	gl_balances(period, entity, account, au, sub_account, instrument, amount, source)
	•	report_balances(period, report, entity, account, ... , amount, source)
	•	mapping_dim(account -> report_line, entity -> hierarchy, etc.)
	•	recon_results(period, report, keys..., gl_amt, rpt_amt, variance_amt, variance_pct, threshold_flag, status)
	•	variance_comments(variance_id, comment, classification, created_by, created_ts)
	•	workflow_tasks(variance_id, assigned_to, role, status)
	•	audit_log(event_ts, user, action, object_type, object_id, before_json, after_json)

Phased delivery plan (what you’ll present to leadership)

Phase 0 — Align & lock POC success criteria
	•	Confirm 1–2 reconciliations to prototype
	•	Confirm thresholds and hierarchy levels
	•	Confirm Maker/Checker roles for demo

Deliverable: POC scope doc + demo script

Phase 1 — Data model + ingestion
	•	Load sample GL + report extracts
	•	Standardize keys (entity/account/hierarchy)
	•	Produce “cleansed attribute data” output

Deliverable: Conformed tables + DQ checks

Phase 2 — Reconciliation engine + variance outputs
	•	Join report vs GL at defined levels
	•	Compute variance amounts and flags
	•	Store recon results (repeatable runs)

Deliverable: reconciliation tables + rerunnable pipeline

Phase 3 — Web UI + workflow + audit
	•	Dashboard + drill-down
	•	Maker explanation + Checker approval
	•	Audit log and evidence pack exports
	•	Period lock (read-only post-final)

Deliverable: demoable portal + exported evidence pack

Phase 4 — Executive readout + next-step roadmap
	•	What worked, what needs scaling
	•	Gaps to productionize (security, data volumes, integration)
	•	2026+ implementation roadmap aligned to CR360

Deliverable: leader deck + recommended funding path

⸻

What leaders care about (include these on slides)

POC outcomes / metrics
	•	Reduction in manual effort (time-to-explain a variance)
	•	% of variances explained and approved before close
	•	Consistency of mappings and hierarchies
	•	Audit readiness (evidence pack completeness, lock controls)
	•	Reusability for downstream teams (single source of truth)

Risk controls (say this explicitly)
	•	“AI/automation is advisory only in POC” (no auto-commit)
	•	Maker/Checker segregation of duties
	•	Immutable audit trail + lock after finalization
