CRIT Enterprise GL Model – Solution Architecture (Prototype / Target State)
This document summarizes the problem statement, target solution, and an end-to-end solution architecture/data-flow. It is designed to accompany the leadership presentation deck.

1. Problem Statement (Current State)
• Numerous GL reconciliations are performed across CRIT systems/teams without a standardized, centralized model.
• Reconciliations vary by scope, process, tools, cleansing approach, hierarchies used, and level of granularity.
• Duplicated work occurs downstream; audit evidence is inconsistent and costly to assemble.

2. What We Are Doing (Objectives)
Discovery & Design (2025 P3–P4): survey existing reconciliations/reporting, collect use cases, review workflows/tools/controls, define best practices, design a consolidated GL model (cleansing + reconciliation methodology), and integrate into CR360 enterprise/product models.

Implementation (2026+): implement the CRIT Enterprise GL Model in CR360 (dependent on funding).

3. What the Solution Will Include (Capabilities)
• Consolidated repositories:
 – GL sourcing data (cleansed/transformed) joined to lowest-level balances
 – CRRT balances at all available levels joined to hierarchies (LOB, Legal Entity, Y-9C, Call Report, SEC, etc.)
 – Reconciliation variances capturing known variances and commentary
• Portal & controls:
 – Web UI for report vs GL comparison, drill-down, and variance explanations
 – Workflow (maker/checker), entitlements, audit log, and period locking
 – Evidence outputs for SOX/RCSA and downstream consumers

4. End-to-End Solution Architecture (Target State)
High-level flow:

GL & CRRT/Report Sources
 → Ingest + Standardize (DQ gates, cleansing, conformed keys)
 → CR360 Enterprise GL Model (balances + reconciliation engine + variance store)
 → Portal (drill-down + explanations) + Workflow (maker/checker)
 → Audit log + Evidence pack exports
 → Downstream enterprise/product models and reporting

5. Operating Model (People, Process, Controls)
Roles:
• Viewer (read-only)
• Maker (creates/updates variance explanations and evidence)
• Checker/Approver (reviews and certifies)
• Admin (entitlements/config)

Close cadence:
T-0 ingest & DQ gates → T-1 reconciliation run → T-2 maker analysis → T-3 checker approval/certification → T-4 period lock + evidence pack.
